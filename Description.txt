Cozy Bean Cafe – A Warm & Inviting Homepage

This project is a single-page website for a fictional Cafe named “Cozy Bean Cafe.” 
The concept captures the charm of a local neighborhood Cafe where fresh brews, 
comforting snacks, and relaxing vibes come together. 

The design uses a warm coffee-inspired color palette with soft browns and creamy 
tones to create a cozy, homelike feeling. A large hero image showcases the cafe’s 
atmosphere, while elegant typography and clean sections highlight the cafe’s 
specialties. CSS hover effects, smooth animations, and responsive styling ensure
the site always looks inviting and fast on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens." 

The goal of this design was to bring out the cozy, friendly spirit of a cafe using 
only HTML and CSS, proving that aesthetic design can be achieved without JavaScript.
